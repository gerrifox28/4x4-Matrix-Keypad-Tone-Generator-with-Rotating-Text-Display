# 4x4-Matrix-Keypad-Tone-Generator-with-Rotating-Text-Display
A two part project built for the DE1-SoC board that uses a connected 4x4 Matrix Keypad to play tones via the connected DE1-SoC board speaker from C5-C7. The code also uses the DE1-SoC board seven segment display that displays my name "Gerri Fox" followed by "Fall 2020" in a rotating manner.
