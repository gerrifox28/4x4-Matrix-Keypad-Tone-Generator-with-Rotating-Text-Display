# 4x4-Matrix-Keypad-Tone-Generator-with-Rotating-Text-Display
A two part project built for the DE1-SoC board that uses a connected 4x4 Matrix Keypad to play tones via the connected DE1-SoC board speaker from C5-C7. The code also uses the DE1-SoC board seven segment display that displays my name "Gerri Fox" followed by "Fall 2020" in a rotating manner.

The code is written using Quartus Verilog and uses knowledge of circuits and logic gates such as AND, OR, NOT gates, inverters, and state machines, comparators as well as D-Flip Flops, Multiplexers, Shifts
